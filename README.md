Introduction To AJAX Technology
===============================

In this project, we learnt about AJAX browser technology and how to integrate JSON data objects from third parties within a web-page. This project involves pulling in user-profile data from Github's API.  A central search field allows the user to search through GitHub usernames.  On submission, data regarding the user's number of repos and commits is published on the page.  Due to the structure of Github's API, 3 data sources are actually referenced in order to populate the page with the desired data.  To account for different connection speeds and to provide for a better user experience, jQuery is deployed to show a spinner graphic while the data is sourced.  The background is an SVG file.  This can be scaled to infinite proportions without sacrificing any visual quality.  SVG is going to be an area of future study for me.  The project can be [can be found here](https://pure-coast-6680.herokuapp.com).  The design should be improved with time.
